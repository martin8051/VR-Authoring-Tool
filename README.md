# Virtual Reality Lab Authoring Tool
---

With the advancement in technologies nowday, technologies are only as advanced and useful as they are if applied. Therefore, using virtual reality as a platform for teaching and learning is a practical application of technology. The main inspiration for this project is to create a cross-platform application tool that would allow teachers to use virutal reality to teach their students. Teachers are able to select prebuilt scenes, replica of math, science classroom and so on, and upload objects into those selected scenes. Once a scene is published, students are then able to inspect the scene and objects loaded inside using a link provided by their teacher. This application also provides a dashboard for teachers to manage their published scenes and for students to view the scenes they have access to.
